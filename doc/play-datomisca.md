# Play Datomisca

[Play Datomisca](https://github.com/dwhjames/play-datomisca) is a module for [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org) that enables you to use Datomisca from within Play in a seamless way.

For now, it’s quite raw and doesn’t provide much on top of Datomisca, but more features will be progressively added, such as help to configure Datomic.

> Play Datomisca is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dwhjames/play-datomisca)


## Usage

See the [Play Datomisca releases](https://github.com/dwhjames/play-datomisca/releases)
